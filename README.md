# Thought-Sharer
An api for a social media app that allows users to share their thoughts.

The api runs using a mongoDB database with routes set up using the Mongoose package. The database allows users to create a user, add friends, make thoughts, and react to thoughts. Users can also delete their users, thoughts, and reactions.

To run the api, download the code, and set it up in a trusted location. In the folder it is in, make sure to have express.js, mongodb, mongoose, and node.js installed. After that, run it with npm start, then test the routes through your preferred method.

Below is a video tutorial that runs you through using the routes in insomnia core: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/BlW1OmjUQHiIImY4hi97
